With a focus on structure and precision, its philosophy hypothesizes that clean lines and simple shapes of geometric forms can create a sense of order, clarity, and efficiency.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n![Neo2](/images/neo-tetra/neo2.png \"neo2\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\nContemporary adaptations of the movement’s design principals further embrace the minimalistic geometry explored by the school, creating bold designs that incorporate basic shapes and limited color palettes. They embody a continuation of such utilitarian view on design, stripping away the inessentials.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n![Neo3](/images/neo-tetra/neo3.png \"neo3\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Initial Sketches**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nTo stay true to Bauhaus philosophy, I want to make the typeface monospaced, with each alphabet encompassed in a perfect square to create the sense of unity and balance. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n![Neo4](/images/neo-tetra/neo4.png \"neo4\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Digital Construction**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn the computer I started to experiment with two different construction guidelines to generate two sets of alphabets. I wanted to keep these logo grids as simple as possible.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n![Neo5](/images/neo-tetra/neo5.png \"neo5\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe result came out as follows. The faintlier makred ones are questionable, but I was generally happy with the legibility of most forms.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n![Neo6](/images/neo-tetra/neo6.png \"neo6\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI decided to then merge the two grids and create a version that makes use of effective elements from both versions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n![Neo7](/images/neo-tetra/neo7.png \"neo7\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis ended up being the final construction guide.

With a focus on structure and precision, its philosophy hypothesizes that clean lines and simple shapes of geometric forms can create a sense of order, clarity, and efficiency.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/neo-tetra/neo2.png\" alt=\"Neo2\" title=\"neo2\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Contemporary adaptations of the movement’s design principals further embrace the minimalistic geometry explored by the school, creating bold designs that incorporate basic shapes and limited color palettes.
