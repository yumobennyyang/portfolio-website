  "overview": "During the summer of 2023 I interned at Tencent’s Interactive Entertainment Group (IEG) as an interface and interaction designer. The majority of my work involved creating HTML5 visuals and fine-tuning UI/UX for the Tencent Games Joy Club mobile app, which I am unable to share. However, I was also assigned a separate solo task of a complete overhaul of the B2E recommender system used to promote content across all Tencent gaming apps. On this page I will go through snippets of my redesign of the Dora Platform, a formerly-in-bad-shape web app actively used by 500+ employees.",
