**Timeline** 

&nbsp;


June 2020 - 
* I thought it would be fun to go into photoshop and merge the most powerful figures in the United States to visualize the faces of 5 fictional leaders representing American power in fields of religion, wealth, military, legislation, and education. Apart from the conclusion that the five imaginary humans look almost identical, lots can be inferred from the personal backgrounds of the 100 individuals. While diversity is ultimately an imperfect means to an end of reducing discrimination, the fact that American social and political power is held by essentially the same demographic is certainly thought-provoking. 

&nbsp;

June 2023 - 
* Exactly 3 years after finishing this project, I decided to revisit this project and rebuild the same men with the help of computer vision, which now has phenomenal capacities for facial recognition and reconstruction. This process yields five clearer and more definitive faces. I also ran across tools such as pauldubois98’s FaceMerge2 that would have made my process in 2020 a lot faster. 

&nbsp;

Both results are displayed.
