  overview: "Columbia University’s self-sustaining news publication, the Daily Spectator, publishes online five days a week and in physical editions once a week. As Head Product Designer of the organization, I designed and shipped an app with my team to enhance the platform’s mobile accessibility and interactivity, serving as a replacement of the web browser experience.",

    { "type": "text", "text": "Spectator’s Engagement analytics report an increasing consumption of Spectator articles on mobile devices, with more and more users being directed to the Spectator’s mobile website from the organization’s instagram posts. However, a quick scan of the CDS website on mobile phones yields many problems as the visual layout on a desktop does not translate well onto a smaller screen. Thus, the product team at Spectator began ideating a different news viewing experience to replace the web browser: a mobile app." },

    { "type": "text", "text": "We found existing research on mobile app demand and trends, and also sent out surveys about news consumption to 1) Spectator Staff, who spend half their life on the spectator website and have a full understanding of the site down to its tiniest inefficiencies and 2) other Columbia undergraduate students, who is our main target audience and can provide good general feedback for the current method of viewing Spectator news." },

    { "type": "text", "text": "An app is easier to access, easier to browse, and easier to share, resulting in an increased user activity and a more profound brand influence & mobile presence. An app also allows for expanded functionalities including story-telling through more specific sections and subsections, tighter integration between print and mobile formats, customizable notifications system, personalization of feed, offline reading, etc." },

    { "type": "text", "text": "This project marked my first experience shipping a product all the way from stakeholder interviews before wireframing to user testings after launch, deepening my understanding of the complexities involved in designing an app. Through continuous communication with the engineering team, I learned to navigate technical limitations and integrate this knowledge into the design process. The successful launch enhanced my skills in balancing design aspirations with practical application constraints, which, in my opinion, set a strong foundation for my future projects with 0->1 startups." },
