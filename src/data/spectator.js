    { "type": "section", "text": "Context", "secondaryText": "Spectator’s Engagement analytics report an increasing consumption of Spectator articles on mobile devices, with more and more users being directed to the Spectator’s mobile website from the organization’s instagram posts. However, a quick scan of the CDS website on mobile phones yields many problems as the visual layout on a desktop does not translate well onto a smaller screen. Thus, the product team at Spectator began ideating a different news viewing experience to replace the web browser: a mobile app." },

    { "type": "section", "text": "Conclusion", "secondaryText": "An app is easier to access, easier to browse, and easier to share, resulting in an increased user activity and a more profound brand influence & mobile presence. An app also allows for expanded functionalities including story-telling through more specific sections and subsections, tighter integration between print and mobile formats, customizable notifications system, personalization of feed, offline reading, etc." },

The successful launch enhanced my skills in balancing design aspirations with practical application constraints, setting a foundation for my future projects with 0->1 startups." },
