  overview: "Cartier: The Power of Magic features 300 iconic Cartier collection pieces and archives in dialogue with over 30 Chinese cultural relics, all under the Visual Direction of cAI™, the AI model custom-developed by Cai studio. I designed display backdrops by tweaking and compositing visuals from cAI™, tailoring the compositions to complement the specific window shapes and jewelry placements, and also incorporating three types of carvings: Relief, Shadow, and Openwork for the manufactoring process.",
