    { "type": "text", "text": "The Bauhaus is one of the most influential movements in the history of design. With a focus on structure and precision, its philosophy hypothesizes that clean lines and simple shapes of geometric forms can create a sense of order, clarity, and efficiency." },
    { "type": "smallImage", "src": "/images/neo-tetra/font1.png" },

    { "type": "text", "text": "Contemporary adaptations of the movementâ€™s design principles further embrace the minimalistic geometry explored by the school, creating bold patterns made from the most basic shapes. They embody a continuation of the utilitarian view on design, stripping away the inessentials." },

    { "type": "section", "text": "Ideation" },

    { "type": "text", "text": "Per Bauhaus philosophy, I designed the typeface as monospaced, placing each letter within a perfect square to evoke unity, balance, and geometric clarity." },

    { "type": "smallImage", "src": "/images/neo-tetra/font6.png" },

    { "type": "text", "text": "The shapes will either link or not, leaving out thin lines throughout each glyph. These subtle separations are what help distinguish characters with the same silhouette." },
    { "type": "smallImage", "src": "/images/neo-tetra/font7.png" },

    { "type": "text", "text": "Many forms went through multiple iterations. Staying consistent with the overall style while preserving the legibility and uniqueness of each character was a challenge." },

    { "type": "text", "text": "The catalog was kept as concise as possible for its purpose and excluded symbols that would not have much use for a display typeface. That being said, non-period circles were added to be used to complement the rest of the text design." },
